              The Tasting Room
         Where History Comes Alive

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Look up. That original 19th-century tin ceiling has witnessed 
over 130 years of Napa stories. Built for Dr. Edwin Hennessey—
the county's first physician and namesake of Lake Hennessey—
this room now hosts a different kind of gathering.

Each morning, settle into your seat for a chef-prepared breakfast. 
Each evening, return for complimentary wine and local conversation. 
The tin ceiling doesn't judge. It just listens.

fruits, warm pastries, and made-to-order plates that fuel 
your day of discovery.

Linger over a second cup. Compare notes on yesterday's 
favorite winery. Plan today's adventure with fellow travelers 
who've quickly become friends.

Breakfast is included. The memories are complimentary.

          About the Hennessey Estate
      Where Napa History Meets Modern Luxury

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

                    ✦ EST. 1889 ✦

[Historic B&W Photo]

In 1889, when Napa Valley was still finding its identity, 
Dr. Edwin Z. Hennessey—the county's first physician—built 
this Queen Anne Victorian as his family home. A civic leader 
so beloved that the county named its primary water source 
after him, Dr. Hennessey chose this spot for a reason: 
close enough to serve his patients, peaceful enough to 
restore his own spirit.

Today, Lake Hennessey still provides water to Napa County. 
And this estate—now a proud listing on the National Register 
of Historic Places—provides something equally essential: 
a place to pause, to reconnect, to remember why you came 
to wine country in the first place.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

              The Restoration

[Photo: Original tin ceiling / restored detail]

Look up in our tasting room. That 19th-century tin ceiling? 
Original. The intricate Stick-Eastlake woodwork throughout 
the estate? Painstakingly preserved. We believe luxury isn't 
about erasing history—it's about honoring it while adding 
the comforts today's traveler expects.

Private baths with rainfall showers. Molton Brown amenities. 
Curated bedding that makes you want to sleep in. A heated 
pool that Dr. Hennessey himself would have envied.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

            Your Chapter Begins

[Photo: Modern room interior or guest enjoying property]

The best Napa experiences aren't just about wine. They're 
about the story you return home with. The breakfast 
conversation with travelers from three states away. The 
sunset swim after your fifth tasting of the day. The 
evening on the veranda, watching the garden lights 
flicker on.

Step into a piece of Napa's past—refined for today.
